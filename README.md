Hack in the north.

The Gather app is a social app that was aimed to increase in-person 
interaction between individuals. Unlike other major social apps that focus on 
solely chatting or online dating, the Gather app focuses on organizing 
and managing an event, that can be attended by large groups of people. 
Be it a sports match, a party,  garage-sale or even probably a hackathon, 
or even two people  who may be interested in dating or a couple friends meeting 
to catch up about their lives - the app does it all.

Gather lets you join events of various kinds like movies, sports, trips, hangouts, 
date, volunteering services, cool projects and many more.
